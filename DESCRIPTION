Description: R's Integrative Transcriptomic Analysis (RITA). is the R package for ITA. ITA is based on large catalogues
of published, respiratory tissue transcriptomic datasets (RNA-seq and microarray). Published data from lung tissues 
include asthma, COPD, cancer, particle inhalation, smoking, fibrotic disease, fetal development, influenza, tuberculosis
and coronaviruses (MERS, SARS, SARS-CoV-2). This amounts to a rich resource for discovering pathogenic mechanisms in
viral infections, unaffected by limitations in known gene functions or disease pathways.
  ITA can explore gene modules discovered in various lung pathologies, e.g. fibrosis or influenza infection.
