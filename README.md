# RITA
R for Integrated Transcriptomics Analysis (RITA). This is the R package that is part of the manuscript "DEEP INTEGRATED NETWORK ANALYSIS: A DATA-DRIVEN BIOINFORMATIC RESOURCE FOR RESPIRATORY DISEASE RESEARCH". This package lays out the functions to process and analyze data from manually curated published transcriptomic datasets. Statistically conserved gene-gene interactions are used here to produce integrated gene networks. These networks can be used disease pathway identifcation and can be used to perform data-driven functional annotation from current scientific knowledge.
